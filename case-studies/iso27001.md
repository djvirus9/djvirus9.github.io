# Case Study: ISO 27001 Readiness as Security Ownership

## Context
As the organization scaled its product, engineering teams, and cloud footprint, ISO 27001:2022 readiness became a business requirement rather than a future goal. While individual controls existed in pockets, there was no centralized ownership of information security governance, no clear evidence trail, and limited alignment between technical controls and compliance expectations.

I took on the role of primary Security SPOC for ISO 27001 readiness, responsible for aligning people, process, and technology across the organization.

## Problem Statement
The core challenges were structural and organizational:
- No single owner accountable for ISO 27001 outcomes
- Security controls implemented inconsistently across teams
- Limited audit-ready documentation and evidence
- Engineering controls not clearly mapped to ISO requirements
- Compliance perceived as paperwork rather than risk management
- Risk of "paper compliance" without real security posture improvement

The business needed credible readiness, not a last-minute audit scramble.

## My Role and Ownership
I acted as the end-to-end owner of security readiness, including:
- Serving as the primary ISO 27001:2022 SPOC
- Translating ISO requirements into actionable technical and process controls
- Coordinating across Engineering, IT, HR, Finance, and Leadership
- Defining ownership, evidence expectations, and review cadence
- Ensuring controls reflected real operational security, not just documentation

This role required influence without authority and deep understanding of both security engineering and governance.

## Strategy and Execution
### 1. Control Mapping to Reality
Instead of starting with policies, I began by:
- Mapping existing technical controls (AppSec, Cloud, CI/CD) to ISO clauses
- Identifying gaps between documented controls and actual practice
- Prioritizing controls with real risk reduction value

This avoided retrofitting policies to systems that did not support them.

### 2. Embedding Security into Business Processes
I worked with non-engineering teams to integrate security into everyday workflows:
- Access management and joiner-mover-leaver processes (HR and IT)
- Asset ownership and data classification
- Incident handling and escalation paths
- Vendor and third-party risk inputs

The goal was to make security repeatable and auditable, not dependent on individuals.

### 3. Evidence and Audit Readiness
A major focus was building audit-ready evidence without overburdening teams:
- Defined what "good evidence" looks like for each control
- Centralized evidence sources (logs, tickets, configs, reports)
- Ensured evidence reflected ongoing operation, not point-in-time snapshots

This reduced audit anxiety and last-minute effort.

### 4. Risk-Based Decision Making
Where full compliance was not immediately feasible, I:
- Documented risk acceptance decisions
- Worked with leadership on prioritization
- Ensured trade-offs were explicit and reviewed

This maintained trust with stakeholders while keeping security grounded in reality.

## Impact and Outcomes
- Established a clear ownership model for ISO 27001 readiness
- Aligned technical security controls with compliance requirements
- Enabled cross-functional teams to participate effectively in security
- Reduced dependency on ad-hoc, manual compliance efforts
- Built a foundation for sustainable certification, not one-time audits

Most importantly, ISO 27001 readiness became a by-product of good security practices, not a parallel effort.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Security Governance and Risk Management • ISO 27001:2022 Control Interpretation • Cross-Functional Stakeholder Management • Audit Evidence Design and Review • Translating Compliance into Engineering Reality • Risk Acceptance and Documentation

### Skills & Signals
ISO 27001:2022 · Compliance Readiness · Audit Readiness · Security Governance · Risk Management · Stakeholder Management

## Why This Matters
This case study demonstrates my ability to own security outcomes beyond tooling, operate effectively at the intersection of engineering, governance, and business, and enable compliance without slowing product delivery -- a core expectation for Senior and Principal Security Engineers in regulated environments.
