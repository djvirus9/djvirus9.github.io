# Building Product Security from Scratch (Licious)

## Problem
- No centralized product security function
- Security findings scattered across teams
- No consistent AppSec/Cloud security coverage

## Approach
- Integrated SAST (Semgrep) + container scanning (Trivy) into CI/CD
- Introduced AWS CSPM (Prowler/ScoutSuite) for misconfig visibility
- Created triage workflows and fixed ownership mapping
- Embedded security into SDLC with developer-first enablement

## Impact
- Reduced critical production-bound vulnerabilities by ~30%
- Improved remediation speed and developer adoption
- Established repeatable governance and reporting

## Key Skills Demonstrated
AppSec • DevSecOps • AWS Security • Program Ownership
