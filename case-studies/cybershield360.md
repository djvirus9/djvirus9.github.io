# CyberShield360 — Building an Attack Surface Management Product from Scratch

## Context
CyberShield360 was built to help organizations gain continuous visibility into external attack surface exposure. The goal was to move beyond periodic penetration tests by providing a productized, repeatable view of real-world exposure across internet-facing assets.

## Problem Statement
Security teams lacked a consistent way to map and monitor public-facing assets and emerging exposures at scale. Existing approaches were manual, point-in-time, and hard to operationalize across multiple clients and environments.

## My Role and Ownership
I owned the end-to-end build of CyberShield360, including:
- Product architecture and security design decisions
- Defining the data pipeline for external asset discovery and exposure analysis
- Translating security requirements into an operational product roadmap
- Collaborating with engineering and leadership to scope, build, and launch

## Architecture and Approach
- Designed a modular pipeline for discovery, enrichment, and risk scoring of external assets
- Focused on signal quality to highlight actionable exposure rather than noise
- Prioritized repeatability and scalability to support multiple environments and clients
- Ensured outputs were usable by security teams for triage and remediation

## Launch and Industry Showcase
The product was launched publicly and demonstrated in industry-facing sessions to validate usability and outcomes with real security teams.

## Impact
- Delivered a production-ready ASM product from zero to launch
- Enabled continuous external exposure monitoring as a repeatable security capability
- Provided a structured approach for prioritizing high-risk external findings

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Product Security Architecture • Attack Surface Management • Security Data Pipelines • Risk Prioritization • Cross-Functional Delivery

## Why This Matters
This case study demonstrates my ability to build a security product from scratch, make architecture decisions under real-world constraints, and deliver an operational capability that security teams can adopt at scale.
