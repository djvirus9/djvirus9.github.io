# Security Ownership Overview

## Who I Am
Senior Product Security Engineer with 6+ years of experience owning and scaling security programs end-to-end across application security, cloud security (AWS), DevSecOps, compliance, and external vulnerability detection.

I specialize in building security functions from zero, operating them at scale, and embedding security into engineering workflows without slowing delivery.

## What I Own (Not Just What I Do)
I operate as a security owner, not a point contributor.

End-to-end ownership includes:
- Product Security strategy and execution
- Application, API, mobile, and cloud security risk
- DevSecOps controls embedded into CI/CD
- Bug bounty program governance and triage
- Vulnerability lifecycle from discovery to remediation to prevention
- ISO 27001:2022 readiness as primary Security SPOC
- Security risk communication with engineering and leadership

## How I Approach Security
My security philosophy is risk-based, developer-first, and outcome-driven.

- I prioritize exploitability and blast radius, not checklist compliance
- I embed security early in the SDLC, not as a late gate
- I design controls that engineers trust and adopt
- I focus on reducing real attack paths, not inflating metrics
- I treat compliance as a by-product of good security, not paperwork

## Core Security Domains I Own
**Product and Application Security**
- Secure design reviews, threat modeling, and real-world attack path analysis
- Web, API, mobile security assessments
- Business-logic and authorization flaw detection

**DevSecOps and Automation**
- SAST and container security embedded into CI/CD
- Risk-based enforcement instead of blanket blocking
- Security signal tuned for developer adoption

**Cloud Security (AWS)**
- Attack path analysis across IAM, networking, and services
- CSPM-driven visibility with exploitability-focused prioritization
- Secure cloud architecture guidance without operational disruption

**Bug Bounty and External Signal**
- Scope definition, severity taxonomy, and payout governance
- High-signal triage and engineering-ready remediation
- Integration of external findings into internal security programs

**Governance and Compliance**
- ISO 27001:2022 readiness ownership
- Control mapping to real technical systems
- Audit evidence design and cross-functional coordination

## What I’ve Delivered
- Built Product Security from scratch as first security hire
- Reduced critical production-bound vulnerabilities by ~30%
- Standardized security coverage across CI/CD pipelines
- Identified and remediated high-risk AWS attack paths
- Scaled and governed bug bounty programs with high signal quality
- Enabled sustainable ISO 27001 readiness without \"paper compliance\"

## How I Add Value to Organizations
I help organizations:
- Move from reactive security to proactive risk reduction
- Scale security without slowing engineering teams
- Make informed security trade-offs, not fear-driven decisions
- Build trust between security, engineering, and leadership
- Prepare for audits while improving real security posture

## Best-Fit Roles
This profile is best suited for:
- Senior or Principal Product Security Engineer
- Senior Application Security Engineer
- Senior Cloud Security Engineer (product-focused)
- Security Lead (individual contributor track)

Especially effective in:
- Product companies
- Fintech and healthtech
- Cloud-native organizations
- Regulated environments (UAE, MEA)

## What You Can Expect From Me
- Ownership, not hand-holding
- Clear communication, not noise
- Practical security decisions
- Strong collaboration with engineers
- Accountability for outcomes
